# CountEx-VQA - Counterfactual Explanations for Visual Question Answering
This repository contains the code for my Master's thesis "Generating Counterfactual Images for VQA by Editing Question Critical Objects" at WeST, University of Koblenz-Landau.
The thesis was supervised by Prof. Dr. Matthias Thimm and Dr. Zeyd Boukhers. This repo was made by [Timo Hartmann](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Timo-Hartmann-3). We developed this code to generate counterfactual images for a VQA model to increase its interpretability.
